# End-to-End Customer Segmentation & CLV Prediction Dashboard

## üìä Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data science project focused on analyzing customer behavior for an e-commerce business. The primary goal is to segment customers based on their purchasing history using RFM analysis and to predict their future value (Customer Lifetime Value - CLV). All insights are presented in a fully interactive web dashboard built with Streamlit.
